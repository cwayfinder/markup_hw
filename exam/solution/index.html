        <h3>ABC University</h3>

        <p>In 1865, Ezra Cornell founded an institution "where any person can find instruction in any study." From
            the beginning, all students were welcome, regardless of race, gender, ideology, or socioeconomic
            status.</p>

        <p>Today, we invite you to join our talented and diverse students and accessible faculty who, together, form
            a living and learning community unmatched in its breadth of opportunities.</p>
