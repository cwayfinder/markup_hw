        <h3>ABC University</h3>

        <p>In 1865, Ezra Cornell founded an institution "where any person can find instruction in any study." From the
            beginning, all students were welcome, regardless of race, gender, ideology, or socioeconomic status.</p>

        <p>Today, we invite you to join our talented and diverse students and accessible faculty who, together, form a
            living and learning community unmatched in its breadth of opportunities.</p>
